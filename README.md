Clusters 10 and 11 were enriched 240 in proteins from several cell-to-cell communication pathways, such as pathways on antigen
241 processing and presentation, ECM-receptor interaction, PD-L1 expression and PD-1 checkpoint,
242 B-cell receptor signaling, chemokine signaling and T-cell receptor signaling. These
243 clusters were also enriched in proteins from other cell signaling pathways, such as apoptosis,
244 calcium signaling, Fc Î³ receptor-mediated phagocytosis, insulin signaling, insulin secretion
245 pathway, and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways . Clusters 10 and 11 were also
246 overrepresented in lipid (estrogen, phosphatidylinositol, phospholipase D and sphingolipid)-
247 mediated signaling pathways . Metabolic proteins, such as from the citrate cycle,
248 cysteine and methionine metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and
249 pentose phosphate pathways, were enriched especially in cluster 11. Proteins from
250 DNA replication, RNA transcription (RNA polymerase and spliceosome) and protein translation
251 (ribosome and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis) processes were enriched in cluster 9 ,
252 which was not enriched with EV markers. Proteins from the complement and
253 coagulation cascades were highly enriched in clusters 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 and 14, and to a lesser
254 extent in clusters 3, 10 and 15. These results suggest that EVs may play a role in
255 diverse communication and signaling pathways, in addition to being enriched with specific
256 metabolic pathways. Proteins from DNA replication, RNA transcription, protein translation, and
257 contaminant proteins from complement and coagulation pathways segregated to clusters that
258 were not enriched for EV markers, showing that it is possible to distinguish between EV proteins
259 and other contaminants.
